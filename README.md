# Telethon
**Telethon** is Telegram client implementation in Python. This project is **completely based** on [TLSharp](https://github.com/sochix/TLSharp), so please, also have a look to the original project!

### Requirements
This project requires the following Python modules, which can be installed by issuing `sudo -H pip install <module>` on a Linux terminal:
- `pyaes` ([GitHub](https://github.com/ricmoo/pyaes), [package index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyaes))

### We need your help!
As of now, the project is fully **untested** and with many pending things to do. If you know both Python and C#, please don't think it twice and help us (me)!
